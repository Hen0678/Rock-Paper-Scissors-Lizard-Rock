# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Rock

[View the live project here]

## Overview
This Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game is a twist on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors. First seen in the Big Bang Theory, users can choose one of five options and the computer will randomly generate an option. The user's choice will be two of the remaining choices, lost to two and draw with one. To make the game more interesting a scoreboard will keep track of the score. 

The game includes a landing page with links to an instructions page or the game itself. A computer game theme background has been added along with some retro CSS styling.
